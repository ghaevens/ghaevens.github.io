When I first came across the term Narrative Medicine as a doctoral student in literature I was intrigued. Finally, a prescription that’s side effects might not include dry mouth, stomach upset and weight-gain, but rather a persistent curiosity about imaginary beings. 

As a narrative theorist I studied literary representations of therapeutic narration in mid-century fiction. That is, I paid close attention to how the protagonists of books like *The Bell Jar* and *The Catcher in the Rye* artistically and philosophically pushed back against “therapeutically” talking their way back into the prisons of social conformity in the 50s; how the characters instead used their platform to escape social scripting. I knew that various strains of psychology were now acutely sensitive to how story form could be used to widen rather than narrow the range of perspectives available to a client. But how was the field of medicine planning to “use” of story form? What follows is a very brief introduction to the “narrative turn” in medical practice. 

Theoretically, narrative approaches to medicine began gaining real momentum about twenty years ago. Like Patient-centered care they grew out of a discontent with the developing depersonalization of healthcare (1). Alongside the technological and scientific advances which have revolutionized disease treatment, the sentiment that medicine has lost touch with certain aspects of patient care is prevalent: “[t]ime constraints, technology, and the administrative demands of modern medicine often impede the human connection that is central to clinical care, contributing to physician and patient dissatisfaction” (2). In this way, narrative approaches call for a revitalization of a humanistic ethos in medicine to improve outcomes for patients and doctors alike (3).  

Patient-centered care (PCC) has been defined by the Institute of Medicine as “[p]roviding care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.” In contrast, a 2014 consensus conference of international experts in Narrative-based Medicine (NBM) defined the developing field as “a methodology of clinical intervention based on a specific communicative competence” (4). Though admittedly broad, this definition contextualizes narrative approaches as methods to equip practitioners with specialized communicative tools for carrying out PCC. 

I will focus in on the work of two key proponents of NBM and Narrative medicine, Dr. John Launer and Dr. Rita Charon respectively, and briefly summarize the similarities and differences between these two methodologies of practice. Central to both approaches is the belief that meaning can be derived from the narratives, the stories, patients and doctors tell (5) which can improve scientific understandings of illness (6) and bring benefit to both the patient and the doctor (7). Both hold that beyond the communicative skills necessary to encourage patients to tell the stories of their illnesses (such as listening attentively and showing empathy) that there are interpretive skills specific to the narrative form which can aid doctors both professionally and personally (8). Both disciplines hold that these narrative skills can be learned with training and, through their positions in education, strongly promote that such training begin in medical school. 

A brief explanation of some differences between Launer and Charon’s methodologies can provide an introduction to the utility of these approaches. To enable his practice, Launer has developed a method of questioning called The 7 Cs with which practitioners can engage patients in a “conversation” about their health concerns (9). The aim of this conversation— which includes Curiosity, Complexity and Challenge—is to provide the patient with the opportunity to express the details and context of her illness in story form. In this way, Launer maintains that the doctor, through guided yet non-controlling prompts, can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of the case (ibid). The goal thereafter is to create a shared understanding and plan of treatment, a “new story,” based on these conversations which can help the patient understand and take ownership of their treatment (ibid.). Moreover, a more complex understanding of the patient’s illness can be reached before the pressure to solve the problem limits this process. The ability to maintain an interpretational openness characteristic of the humanities is thus one fundamental narrative skill that doctors can develop through this practice. 

Rita Charon correspondingly defines Narrative Medicine as “medicine practiced with the narrative competence to recognize, absorb, interpret, and be moved by the stories of illness” (10), but her methods are more solidly grounded in literary narrative analysis. Charon holds that medicine can benefit from a better understanding of “what narratives are, how they are built, how they convey their knowledge about the world, what happens when stories are told and listened to, how narratives organize life, and how they let those who live life recognize what it means” (ibid.). In place of Launer’s family therapy-based “conversations,” Charon encourages the interpretation of patient narratives thorough a methodology of “close reading” through a framework of literary analysis (ibid.). In this way, the practice holds that training in reading, writing and understanding stories and how story form contributes to the clinical effectiveness of practitioners: by developing narrative competence, “health care professionals can become more attentive to patients, more attuned to patients’ experiences, more reflective in their own practice, and more accurate in interpreting the stories patients tell of illness” (ibid.). They can, furthermore, gain a better capacity for attentive listening, for adopting outside perspectives: “for following the narrative thread of the story of another, being curious about other people’s motives and experiences, and tolerating the uncertainty of stories” (11). Moreover, throughout her work Charon strongly advocates reflective writing as a method for doctors to improve their practice as well as cope long-term with the emotional demands of practicing medicine. 

In sum, the “narrative” in Narrative Medicine describes not a well-defined treatment option for the patient, but a methodology which medical professional use to heal and promote good health. The patient is generally not gobbling down narrative “pills” themselves, but instead benefitting from the narrative way the medical professional uses to treat them. Narrative is a descriptor, like “Preventative,” which at once describes the method that the medical professional uses and asserts the value of including it in the practitioner’s toolbelt. 

It’s in this way that Charon and Launer’s approaches aim to facilitate the return of the art of medicine, to re-humanize and improve the outcomes of the practice for both patients and doctors. So, yes, a persistent curiosity, but as part of the treatment, not an adverse reaction. And the beings are, of course, real.
