Is there a difference between story and narrative? Don’t they mean the same thing? Is narrative just a jargony way of talking about regular stories? 

Sometimes, is the answer to all these questions. 

The Cambridge Online Dictionary defines story as: “a description, either true or imagined, of a connected series of events.” Narrative is: “a story or description of a series of events.” So, narratives are just stories whose events are unconnected and “undecided” vis-a-vis truth claims? 

Nah. A subordinate definition of narrative as “a particular way of explaining or understanding events” comes, to my mind, closer to explaining the difference between the terms. 

Most of us recognize a story when we’re in the grip of one. There’s a beginning that piques our curiosity and invites us onboard, followed by a middle that we ride, fast or slow, and more or less suspensefully until we get to a climax (brace yourselves, we’re going over!). After this, the story’s tension is released, and its ending revealed. 
Stories share many other aspects: characters, for example, often a main character, and an opponent. The character wants something and the opponent stands in their way, yes. There is a narrator who may or may not be a character in the story. 
And all of this takes place somewhere. At least two places actually: the site of the story and place from which the story is told by the narrator, which differ (if not in space, in time).

There is a great deal more to say about story elements, and many exceptions. But most of us can recognize the stealthily outline of a story moving through our everyday lives, like the pigeon disturbing our lunchtime revery with its aloof intentions on our cream cheese bagel. 

If stories are pigeons, then narratives are doves. That this statement smacks of elitism underlines a common misunderstanding about nomenclature in the Columbidae family of birds. The names don’t refer to a vertical hierarchy, but just a horizontal, linguistic confusion (in English, at least). To non-ornithologists like me, the Latin-derived pigeon recalls the common grey moocher at my feet in the park come lunchtime, whereas the Germanic dove is the soaring symbol of universal peace. 

Not so. The common pigeon is also a Rock Dove. 
And so it is with stories and narratives: we are often referring to the same thing with the same basic elements by a different name. 

But why use a different name then? 
Well, for me the secondary definition of narrative (“a particular way of explaining or understanding events”) comes a little closer to explaining the difference. And, if our bird will indulge us once more by coming forth to demonstrate the analogy, we can ask: when do we call it a pigeon, and when is it a Rock Dove? 

The differentiation is primarily in the lens we use to look at the bird. We hardly notice pigeons in our daily lives. They are everywhere; we mainly just negotiate them. Rock Doves are instead studied: in detailed guidebooks, through sturdy binoculars. When we study narrative, our lens is focused more on the essential qualities and similarities of the species. Some develop standard measurements with which to compare individual specimens (they’re called “narratologists”). This is to better understand their characters and capabilities, collectively and as astonishing hybrids. 

Narrative denotes a certain scientific, distanced stance from what is commonly known as story. It often tells us more about the person using the word and their focus of interest than the object itself. 
We all tell stories in one way or another.
And many also study narratives: how exactly these structures are formed, how they make meaning, and how they affect the way we think and feel. 

Some have begun using narrative to refer to the personal or corporate mythologies scripting, often subconsciously, our lives and businesses. This is certainly a kind of narrative. And there are more of them out there. To my mind, when the sun-struck, iridescence of a pigeon’s plumage suddenly strikes you, or you find yourself wondering how the bird has persuaded the homeless gentleman on the bench adjacent to toss piece after piece of his baguette to it—well, that pigeon’s gone Rock Dove on you.
