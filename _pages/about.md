Hello, my name is Gwen Haevens. I'm a Narrative Specialist and Medical Student. I grew up on islands - in the Canadian Arctic and off the southern Westcoast. I've spent much of my adult life travelling and studying in Europe. I earned my PhD in Literature from Uppsala University in Sweden. For the last three years I've studied medicine at Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg. At the moment, I'm based in Northern California.

I'm so glad that you have found your way to The Narrative Health Studio. As you can see, we're located at the busy intersection where story-telling and well-being meet. Feel free to look around the place. Our goal is to promote health, growth and innovation through a closer study of how narrative works, both on and for us. Make yourself comfortable, and leaf through the reading material.
And do share your thoughts!
