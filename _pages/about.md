Hello, my name is Gwen Haevens. I'm a Narrative Specialist and Medical Student. I grew up on islands - in the Canadian arctic and off the southern west coast. I've spent much of my adult life travelling and studying in Europe. I earned my PhD in English Literature from Uppsala University in Sweden. I study Medicine at Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg. At the moment, I'm based in California.
